# Supervised Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the 'Supervised Machine Learning' repository! This repository is your comprehensive guide to supervised learning techniques in Python, focusing on both classification and regression tasks. Additionally, it includes resources and examples utilizing PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library that simplifies the machine learning workflow.

## Contents

- Classification: Explore classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and more.
- Regression: Dive into regression algorithms including linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression.
- PyCaret: Learn how to leverage PyCaret for streamlined machine learning experimentation, including automated feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

Whether you're new to supervised learning or seeking to enhance your skills, this repository provides valuable content, examples, and resources to support your journey.
